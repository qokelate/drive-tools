Win32 GUI application which sets the registry value MaxTransferLen for
USBSTOR devices under Windows 7 SP1, 8 and 10 (and their Server versions).

Modern USB drives supporting the new USB Attached SCSI protocol are not
listed by this tool unter Windows 8 and 10 since here this new protocol
supported by native Windows drivers. It's all about the old USB mass storage
class devices (and Windows 7 which has no build-in support for UAS).


Since Windows 7 SP1 the block size of USB data transfers of USBSTOR drives
can be changed for each device from the default of 64 KB to a maximum of 2 MB.
A larger transfer length reduces protocol overhead and therefore increases the
transfer speed.

The setting was introduces in 2011 with the Hotfix 2581464 for Windows 7 SP1:
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2581464

Today an updated Windows 7 SP1 is good enough - no need for the hotfix.

The setting is made in the registry on a per USB device base:
Under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\usbstor there are
already some keys for devices which need special treatment as Apple iPods
(05AC12xx and 05AC13xx). The keys are made of eight hex digits, four for the
USB vendor ID and four for the product ID where letter x is used as a wildcard.


How to use:

First make a speed test by right-clicking a drive and select "Test read Speed".

To make the setting right-click a drive in the list and select "Set MaxTransferLen".

Then right-click it again and select "restart device" for the setting to take effect.
The restart can succeed only if no other programm is accessing the drive.

Then test the speed again an see if the linear access gets faster and if it is still
smooth without getting stuck.

Some devices cannot handle a larger transfer length and some USB hubs seem to cause
problems too.

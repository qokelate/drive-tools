
FFB V1.0 - Freeware by Uwe Sieber - www.uwe-sieber.de

FFB - Flush File Buffers is a commandline tool which flushes
the write cache of one or more storage volumes. It is similar
to the Unix sync command or the Sysinternals sync tool.

The name comes from the Win32 API call FlushFileBuffers:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364439(v=vs.85).aspx


The Sysinternals sync tool can flush volumes only which have
a drive letter. And it forgets drive Z: when called without
parameters.

Since V0.9 is skips the flushing of sleeping drives unless -f is given.
VHD, TrueCrpyt and VeraCrypt volumes are resolved to their physical
drives, other file hosted drives are not, so unwanted wakeups might happen.

Since V1.0 it can purge the file cache, discarding even the read cache.
This is done by attempting to open the volume for exclusive read access.
Even if this fails with ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION it purges the cache. This
is undocumented behavior but tested from Windows 2000 up to Windows 10 1709.


Usage:

FFB [VolumeSpec1] [VolumeSpec2] ... [VolumeSpecN] [-d] [-f]

VolumeSpec can be a drive letter, a drive or any kind of mountpoint
-p  purge the file cache
-d  dismount the volume(s) if possible
-f  force dismount (open handles become invalid) or force flush of sleeping drives

Samples:

FFB C
FFB C D E
FFB C: D: E:
FFB C:\ D:\ E:\
FFB C:\CardReader\SD
FFB \\?\Volume{16b5dd59-158f-11e1-b349-00166f0dc865}
FFB \\?\Volume{16b5dd59-158f-11e1-b349-00166f0dc865}\
FFB X: -d -f

Flushing and purging a volume's cache requires admin privileges, so,
restricted users cannot do that.

My Windows service "USB Drive Letter Manager (USBDLM)" since V4.8
has a command interface which FFB can use for flushing the
file cache. Purging needs USBDLM V5.3.
See USBDLM help in section "Settings" for details.

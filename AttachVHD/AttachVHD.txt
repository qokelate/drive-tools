Freeware by Uwe Sieber - www.uwe-sieber.de

Win32 version works on Windows XP and higher. It does not work on x64 version of Windows.
x64 version works on x64 versions Windows only.

Windows 7 and higher have build-in VHD support, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008 need
Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 installed in its default folder (%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Virtual Server\Vhdmount),
here AttachVHD looks for its vhdmount.dll.

Admin previlegs are required or (under Windows 7 and higher) USBDLM V5.4.6+ with CommandInterface 0x100 active.

The posibility to attach a VHD without admin previleges was the reason to create this tool, otherwise there are
Windows diskspart, powershell and vMount: http://reboot.pro/files/file/477-vmount

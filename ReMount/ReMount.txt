ReMount V2.2 - remounts a volume from one mount point to another
Freeware by Uwe Sieber - www.uwe-sieber.de

Usage:

ReMount X: Y:

X: is the current drive letter
Y: is the new drive letter


ReMount . Y:

.  is a placeholder for the current drive
Y: is the new drive letter


If both mountpoint are in use and shall be swapped then use
parameter -s

ReMount X: Y: -s


For nonsense operations, as remonting the Windows system drive
or mounting a local drive to a letter uses by a network drive,
use parameter -f (force). Force can be used too if the
target drive letter is in use. In this case it is remounted
to the first available letter to free it up for the desired
remount.

remount c: x: -f


NTFS mount points can be used too:

ReMount X: "E:\MyCardReader\Slot 1"

X: is the current drive letter
E:\MyCardReader\Slot 1 is the new mount point which must be
                       an empty folder on an NTFS drive


ReMount X: "Slot 1"

X: is the current drive letter
"Slot 1" is the new mount point relative to the current folder
         which must be an empty folder on an NTFS drive


Since V2.2 an administrative network share is changed to the new drive letter.


Works under Windows 2000, XP and higher only.

Under XP it can remount a local drive's letter even it's currently
used as network drive.

Requires administrator privileges.


The Win32 version works under x32 and x64 edtiions of Windows.

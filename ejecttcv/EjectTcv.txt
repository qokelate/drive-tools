
EjectTrueCryptVolume V3.2.0 - 'ejects' a TrueCrypt or VeraCrypt volume
Freeware by Uwe Sieber - www.uwe-sieber.de


Win32 version works Window 2000, XP and higher, including x64 editions.
x64 version works under Windows x64 editions only.

Usage:
EjectTcv DriveSpec [-f][-l][-h][-a][-na][-w:nnnn]

DriveSpec is something that defines the TrueCrpyt Volume to eject,
e.g. U: (the TrueCrypt volume's drive letter)
or its VolumeName like Volume{GUID}
or the path of its container, e.g. a partition name or a file name
-f       force
-l       loop until success
-h       show open handles
-a       activate windows of processes which hold open handles
-na      no about info
-w:nnnn  wait nnnn milliseconds before close


Samples:

EjectTcv T:
EjectTcv T: -L -h
EjectTcv \Device\Harddisk1\Partition1
EjectTcv C:\secret.tc

Parameters are case-insensitive.

Since V2.7 it works with VeraCrypt too.

Ejecting a VeraCrypt volume by its container name works since V1.6 of VeraCrypt
with EjectTcv V2.8+ only and vice versa.



About open handles

EjectTcv does no use a driver for gaterhing handle information. Therefore
when hitting the handle of a waiting pipe under XP the function for getting
the handle name does not return, the thread freezes. Since V3.0 EjectTcv
uses the Win32 call GetFileType to filter out pipes before calling NtQueryObject.
GetFileType freezes too when hitting a pipe but when the EjectTcv process
ends Windows sucessfully kills it in contrast to NtQueryObject.
Since Vista GetFileType doesn't freeze at all, so no more problem since V3.0.

EjectTcv finds handles of processes of the same or lower trust level. So if
it is called restricted then it finds handles of restricted processes only.
Since V3.1 it gets handles of system processes too if started with admin privileges.

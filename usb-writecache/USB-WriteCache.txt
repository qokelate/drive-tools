This tool set two registry parameters "WriteCacheEnableOverride" and "UserRemovalPolicy" for USB disk devices under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\<DeviceID>\Device Parameters\Classpnp

They are read and written by means of the DeviceIoControl calls IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_HOTPLUG_INFO and
IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_HOTPLUG_INFO.
The used STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO data struct has four members that can be read:

typedef struct _STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO {
  DWORD   Size;
  BOOLEAN MediaRemovable;
  BOOLEAN MediaHotplug;
  BOOLEAN DeviceHotplug;
  BOOLEAN WriteCacheEnableOverride;
} STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO, *PSTORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO;

Only DeviceHotplug and WriteCacheEnableOverride can be set, see here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-storage_hotplug_info

While WriteCacheEnableOverride goes 1:1 to the registry value of the same name things are more
complicatied with DeviceHotplug:

DeviceHotplug = FALSE   ->   UserRemovalPolicy = 2 (CM_REMOVAL_POLICY_EXPECT_ORDERLY_REMOVAL)
DeviceHotplug = TRUE    ->   UserRemovalPolicy = 3 (CM_REMOVAL_POLICY_EXPECT_SURPRISE_REMOVAL)


With DeviceHotplug OFF and WriteCacheEnableOverride ON you get the most write cache.

With DeviceHotplug ON and WriteCacheEnableOverride OFF you get almost no write cache.

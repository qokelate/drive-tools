
RestartSrDev V3.1.0 - restarts "Safely Removed" devices which have the "Code 21" or "Code 47" problem code
Freeware by Uwe Sieber - www.uwe-sieber.de

The Win32 version works on Windows 2000, XP and higher. It does not work on x64 version of Windows.
The x64 version works on x64 versions Windows only.

"Code 47" devices can be restarted only by restarting their parent device or by resetting their USB port.


Usage:
RestartSrDev DeviceId [-t][-w:nnnn]

DeviceId: is the devices device instance ID or the friendly name, it can include wildcards
[-f]      force the restart of the parent device even it has other devices attached
[-t]      test only
[-w:nnnn] wait nnnn milliseconds before close
[-d]      debug info


Samples:

RestartSrDev *

RestartSrDev USB\VID_0781*PID_5406*

RestartSrDev USB\VID_0781&PID_5406\0000051017037750

RestartSrDev "Kingston DataTraveler*"

RestartSrDev "Sandisk Extreme"



Admin rights are required.

Returns Errorlevels:

0 - successfully restarted at least one device
1 - no device restarted
2 - other problem



Background information

After using the Windows "Safely Remove Hardware" facility,
a device gets the problem code 47, which is a constant
from the cfg.h: CM_PROB_HELD_FOR_EJECT "The device is offline
awaiting removal".

As far as known, a device with this problem code cannot be
reactivated. The only way for a USB device is to restart
the hub which this device is connected to. This can be a
root hub or a standard hub. But this of course restarts all
devices attached to this hub.

But sometimes devices have problem code 21 after the 
safe removal, which is CM_PROB_WILL_BE_REMOVED "devinst
will remove".
Devices with this problem code can be reactivated by
restarting them.

There is not much information about these problem codes.

It seems that it depends on the API call which is used to
perform the safe removal. There are two:

CM_Query_And_Remove_SubTree and CM_Request_Device_Eject.

CM_Query_And_Remove_SubTree leads to "Code 21" while
CM_Request_Device_Eject leads to "Code 47".


CM_Query_And_Remove_SubTree requires admin privileges
while CM_Request_Device_Eject works for restricted users
too.
The Windows Safe Removal leads to Code 47, so probably
it uses CM_Request_Device_Eject.

My tool RemoveDrive tries CM_Query_And_Remove_SubTree
first and if this fails then it tries CM_Request_Device_Eject.

USBDLM since V4.8 has a command interface thru which RemoveDrive
can call CM_Query_And_Remove_SubTree with admin privileges
and RestartSrDev can reactivate a Code 21 device.


So, if you have admin privileges or USBDLM with activated
command interface and removing a drive by means of RemoveDrive,
then it is possible to reactivate the drive by means of RestartSrDev.

"Code 47" devices can be restarted only by restarting its
parent device which is for USB devices a USB hub.
Of course this restart all devices attached to the hub.
Therefore RestartSrDev refuses the restart unless option -f
is set to force the restart.
Since V3.0 RestartSrDev can restart Code 47 USB devices by resetting
their USB port. This works under XP, Windows 8, 10, 11 with the
Microsoft standard USB drivers.

On some USB controllers USB devices disappear completely after
safe removal instead of staying present with Code 21 or 47.
Here you can call RemoveDrive with parameter -d to remove the
drive device instead, which RestartSrDev can restart then.
